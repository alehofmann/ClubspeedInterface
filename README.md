# ClubspeedInterface
Clubspeed Interface Layer for Kiosk v15 <br>
This layer was created as an interface between an Automated POS (Kiosk v15) and Clubspeed Race Control System. <br>
It extends Kiosk's functionality to allow retrieving existing Clubspeed customers and heats, booking races, and registering new customers among other things. <br>
A plugin infrastructure was designed to add new features to the Kiosk v15 without disrupting it's code base.
